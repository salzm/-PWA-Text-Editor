# -PWA-Text-Editor

## Description

This Project was to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

## Usage

We were provided starter code to ensure the routes, client and server folder were already organized. From there, I did npm install, installed the idb package for this project, and then began to code in the install js file under the src and js folders. I implemented a click event handler on the butInstall element and added an handler for the appinstalled event.
From there, in the webpack file, I added the return but will go back to add the plugins in a future date. In the src-sw.js file, I implemented asset caching code for the program to chache properly. To run this program, the user would need to start the server in the backend, and then open the index html file under the dist folder. It brings but the application, however, I was unable to get the application to download. I will continue to work on this project to get this fixed and also add a feature to download offline for users.
